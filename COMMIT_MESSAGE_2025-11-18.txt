## Settings Structure Changes
- Move Security & Privacy to dedicated page (security_privacy.php)
- Remove Privacy & Data and Notification Preferences from inline sidebar
- Update settings_sidebar.php navigation to reflect new structure
- Add dedicated security_privacy.php with password change functionality

## Animation System Overhaul
- Remove all sidebar profile animations to fix conflicts on dedicated pages
- Remove page-specific transitions from active_sessions.php, accessibility.php, security_activity.php
- Create unified animation reduction system with two complementary CSS classes

## Enhanced Reduce Animations Feature
- Merge simple-animations functionality into existing Reduce Animations toggle
- Apply both .reduce-animations and .simple-animations classes when enabled
- Update global accessibility.js to apply combined animation reduction
- Completely disable animations while preserving all interactive functionality
- Keep subtle opacity transitions (120ms) for essential user feedback

## High Contrast Removal
- Remove High Contrast Mode feature entirely per user request
- Clean up related UI toggles and CSS rules
- Update accessibility.js to remove high-contrast logic

## Modal Z-Index Fixes
- Fix logout modal appearing behind sidebar
- Add proper z-index layering for modals (1100) and backdrops (1090)
- Ensure modals display correctly with proper positioning

## FOUC Prevention Updates
- Add critical inline CSS to all student pages
- Implement anti-FOUC script with .ready class
- Fix sidebar visibility issues by using body:not(.ready) selector
- Ensure smooth page load experience without flash of unstyled content
